This is the Blender add-on to use for manipulating the .openhab formats.
.openhab are replacing the .ifc convention in the context of BIM-makers.
BIM-makers is a new way of build, based on BIM but focusing on what is necessarry for the 'autoconstructor'.

We had .sti : 1 complex building with tons of people workinh on it.
We have now .openhab : 1 easy construction but with 1 unexperienced person.
